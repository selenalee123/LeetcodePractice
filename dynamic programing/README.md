## About

LeetCode is a popular online platform that offers a collection of coding challenges to improve algorithmic and problem-solving skills. This repository aims to help you enhance your coding abilities by providing solutions to different LeetCode problems.

Each problem solution is organized in its own directory, which includes the following files:
- `problem.md`: A markdown file describing the problem statement, constraints, and examples.
- `solution.py`: A Python file containing the solution code.
- `test_solution.py` (optional): A Python file with test cases to validate the solution.

## Getting Started

To get started with practicing LeetCode problems and solutions, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the specific problem directory you want to work on.
3. Read the `problem.md` file to understand the problem statement, constraints, and examples.
4. Open the `solution.py` file and implement your solution to the problem.
5. If available, use the `test_solution.py` file to run test cases and validate your solution.

## Usage
